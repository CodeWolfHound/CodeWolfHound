Currently, I work as an app developer on the Creator Team at Zoho.

I love playing video games, chatting with others, and solving problems using logic. Right now, I’m learning game development strategies and design to achieve my dream of becoming a game developer!

# Projects
I’m the team lead on a game project with two artists and another programmer, using the Unity Engine.

I’m always eager to learn, even with my limited experience in the field.
